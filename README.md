# MPI-OpenMP-QuickStart

# Introduction
Greetings to all, this repository was created solely and exclusively to start your parallel computing journey. I am going to introduce the OpenMP and MPI frameworks and how someone can start using them, a complete novice will be able to create relatively efficient code if they apply these concepts.

# Environment
For the course, the language C will be used, I love Python with all my heart, but for this specific subject, it is highly recommended to start with C and then move on to the language of your choice. In the modules, you can see how to install the dependencies used, have your gcc updated and that will suffice for the short course.
